Steam Chat Painter
================

A C# tool to create smile patterns to be used in Steam chat conversations!

####Resize the main form!
The drawing grid adjusts its size to fit the form, so after entering different size values into text boxes, make sure to resize the actual form to see the change.

####The "Send" button
The "Send" button copies the whole text, replacing ":"-s with ";"-s in smile names, so that you can send your image to your friend for him to copy it and use somewhere else themselves.

####Separators
The default separator for Steam chat is five space symbols. That way the smiles are perfectly aligned. Unfortunately, you cannot use multiple spaces in Steam comments. The solution is - use SIX "|" symbols! It may not look the best, but it is perfect alignment for Steam comments.

================
This is my first C# program ever, so the code probably looks very bad.
